// The recommended approach to managing relational or nested
// data in the store is to treat a portion of your store as if
// it were a database, and keep that data in a normalized form.
// The basic concepts of normalizing data are: each type of data
// gets its own "table" in the state, each "table" should store
// the individual items in an object with the IDs of the items as
// keys and the items themselves as the values, any references to
// individual items should be done by storing the item's ID, and
// arrays of IDs should be used to indicate ordering.
